Kube Web Framework 4
====

Kube is a minimalistic Web framework for professional developers and designers.

Here’s your most advanced and flexible web framework. Take a look. Kube doesn’t force you into specific styling, Kube doesn’t require rewriting its code; it leaves all of the important decisions to you and your creative genius. Think about Kube as if it was your most reliable helper, who would do your routine job with a smile on his face, so that you can actually concentrate on something big and wonderful.
